# Kuiq - Sidekiq UI

Kuiq (**UI** for Side**kiq**, pronounced "quick") is a native desktop application for Sidekiq administration. It uses the Glimmer toolkit for building native GUIs in Ruby.

Please note this is a prototype and nothing official or usable at the moment.

If you are unfamiliar with Glimmer, you can see a large set of helpful examples by running `gem install glimmer-dsl-libui; glimmer examples`.
