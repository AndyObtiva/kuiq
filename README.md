# Quick - Sidekiq UI

Quick is a native desktop application for Sidekiq admin UI. It uses the Glimmer toolkit for building native GUIs in Ruby.

Please note this is a prototype and nothing official or usable at the moment.

If you are unfamiliar with Glimmer, you can see a large set of helpful examples by running `gem install glimmer-dsl-libui; glimmer examples`.
